# Safe-Start Command

The `safe-start` command-line tool provides a simpler yet secure way to utilize the Node.js permission model.
It supports loading a configuration file and processing its contents, all while ensuring that permissions are handled in an easy-to-use manner.

## Installation

You can run the tool directly without installing it globally by using `npx`:

```sh
npx safe-start [options] [main]
```
